Whack-a-mole is basically a game in which there are holes on a surface and randomly,  the mice(or any animal for instance) pops out constantly from unpredictable holes in an uncertain pattern.  The player has to hit the mole by hammering it using different hammers so it goes away,in this way, the moles  keep popping out from various holes speedily at uncertain holes.
